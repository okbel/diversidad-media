Books, Music, and others. The project is in fast growth and there are many
things to do. We are still covering the basics.

## Running the project

### Prerequisites

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (recommended)
* [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
* [TMDB key](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)
* [Google Books API key](https://developers.google.com/books/)
* [Youtube API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### Setup

Create a `.env` file with your keys, following `.env.example` format.

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn # or npm install
```

### Server

The server connects to TMDB, Google Books and any other backend provider. By
default it listens to port 3000, but you can use another one setting the
`DM_SERVER_PORT` environment variable.

```sh
dotenv yarn watch:server # or dotenv npm run watch-server
```

### Client

The client serves the browser and proxies any backend request to the server. By
default it listens to port 3001, but you can use another one setting the
`DM_CLIENT_PORT` environment variable.

```sh
yarn watch:client # or dotenv npm run watch-client
```
